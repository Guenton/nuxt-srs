# REST API
The following methods will be used for CRUD operations.

CREATE - POST
READ - GET
UPDATE - PUT/PATCH
DELETE - DELETE

**NOTE: The Difference between PUT and PATCH is that PUT has to update the entire resource (more bandwith per server call).**
**PATCH on the other hand will be used to update a single field only.**
